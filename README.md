# Orion - Design System

Orion is a modular and scalable Design System, powered by Jetpack Compose, that aims to standardize
and accelerate the development of modern and accessible interfaces for Android. This project
centralizes reusable visual components, design tokens, and UI/UX best practices.

## ✨ Vision

Provide a solid, consistent and elegant foundation for developing Android interfaces, allowing:

- Reuse of visual and behavioral components;
- Standardization of visual language between different applications;
- Speed and quality in screen construction;
- Continuous evolution based on product and design feedback.

## 🧱 Project Structure

The project is organized in a modular way for easy maintenance and scalability:

## 🪐 Name
Orion is a tribute to the constellation of the same name, representing direction, structure, and
clear vision — the same values we strive for when building quality interfaces.
